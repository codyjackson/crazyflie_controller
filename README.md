Crazyflie Quadcopter Mobile Controller
====================
Makes use of the Crazflie and Tornado Python libraries to enable mobile devicesto act as the controller for the Crazyflie Quadcopter.

To have a mobile act as a controller one simply needs to connect to the software by visiting a webpage. I make use of Html5's deviceorientation event.

Dependencies:
------------
* [Crazyflie](https://bitbucket.org/bitcraze/crazyflie-pc-client)
* [PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download) - Crazyflie is dependent on this. Will be removed when possible.
* [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)
